# AI Blog Generator - Implementation TODO

## Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with shadcn/ui
- [x] Install additional dependencies (cheerio, axios)
- [x] Set up TypeScript types and interfaces

## Backend API Development
- [x] Create URL scraping API endpoint (/api/scrape)
- [x] Create blog generation API (/api/generate-blogs)
- [x] Create image generation API (/api/generate-images)
- [x] Create main orchestration API (/api/blog-generator)

## Frontend Components
- [x] Create main page layout and URL input interface
- [x] Build blog display cards component
- [x] Implement loading states and progress indicators

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Testing & Deployment
- [x] Test URL scraping functionality
- [x] Test AI blog generation with sample URLs
- [x] Test image generation and integration
- [x] Build and deploy application
- [x] API testing completed successfully
- [ ] Browser testing (Playwright setup needed)

## Error Handling & Polish
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [x] Add input validation and sanitization
- [x] Optimize UI/UX and responsive design
- [x] Complete application development
